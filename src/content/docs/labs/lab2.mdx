- Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in wired and wireless networks. It includes the testing of routers, switches, firewalls, VPNs, and other network components.
2. Web Application Penetration Testing:
- Focuses on the security of web applications and their components (e.g., front-end, back-end, APIs).
3. Social Engineering Penetration Testing:
- Simulates social engineering attacks, such as phishing, to evaluate how vulnerable employees are to these types of attacks.
4. Mobile Application Penetration Testing:
- Tests the security of mobile applications, including iOS and Android apps.
5. Wireless Penetration Testing:

<summary>What is Bug Bounty</summary>

A Bug Bounty program is an initiative by organizations, often tech companies, to reward individuals for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities in their software, websites, or applications.

The main goal is to encourage ethical hackers to find and disclose flaws before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
</details>

<details open>
<summary>Bug Bounty programs</summary>

1. Public Bug Bounty Programs:
- Open to anyone who wants to participate.

2. Private Bug Bounty Programs:

</details>

<details open>
<summary>Why Companies use Bug Bounty Programs </summary>

1. Enhanced Security: By incentivizing external researchers to find bugs, companies can uncover vulnerabilities that might have been missed during internal testing.

2. Cost-Effective: Paying for found vulnerabilities is often more cost-effective than dealing with the consequences of a breach.

3. Community Engagement: It fosters a relationship with the security community and can improve the organization's reputation.
