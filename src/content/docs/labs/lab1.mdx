      For Amy, the day began like any other at the Sequential Label and Supply Company

      (SLS) help desk. Taking calls and helping office workers with computer problems was not
      glamorous, but she enjoyed the work; it was challenging and paid well. Some of her friends
      in the industry worked at bigger companies, some at cutting-edge tech companies, but they
      all agreed that jobs in information technology were a good way to pay the bills.
      The phone rang, as it did on average about four times an hour and about 28 times a day.
      The first call of the day, from a worried user hoping Amy could help him out of a jam,
      seemed typical. The call display on her monitor gave some of the facts: the user’s name, his
      phone number, the department in which he worked, where his office was on the company
      campus, and a list of all the calls he’d made in the past.
      “Hi, Bob,” she said. “Did you get that document formatting problem squared away?”
      “Sure did, Amy. Hope we can figure out what’s going on this time.”
      “We’ll try, Bob. Tell me about it.”
      “Well, my PC is acting weird,” Bob said. “When I go to the screen that has my e-mail program running, it doesn’t respond to the mouse or the keyboard.”
      “Did you try a reboot yet?”


      “Sure did. But the window wouldn’t close, and I had to turn it off. After it restarted,
      I opened the e-mail program, and it’s just like it was before—no response at all. The other
      stuff is working OK, but really, really slowly. Even my Internet browser is sluggish.”
      “OK, Bob. We’ve tried the usual stuff we can do over the phone. Let me open a case, and
      I’ll dispatch a tech over as soon as possible.”
      Amy looked up at the LED tally board on the wall at the end of the room. She saw that
      there were only two technicians dispatched to deskside support at the moment, and since it
      was the day shift, there were four available.
      “Shouldn’t be long at all, Bob.”
      She hung up and typed her notes into ISIS, the company’s Information Status and Issues
      System. She assigned the newly generated case to the deskside dispatch queue, which would
      page the roving deskside team with the details in just a few minutes.
      A moment later, Amy looked up to see Charlie Moody, the senior manager of the server
      administration team, walking briskly down the hall. He was being trailed by three of his
      senior technicians as he made a beeline from his office to the door of the server room
      where the company servers were kept in a controlled environment. They all looked
      worried.
      Just then, Amy’s screen beeped to alert her of a new e-mail. She glanced down. It beeped
      again—and again. It started beeping constantly. She clicked on the envelope icon and, after
      a short delay, the mail window opened. She had 47 new e-mails in her inbox. She opened
      one from Davey Martinez, an acquaintance from the Accounting Department. The subject
      line said, “Wait till you see this.” The message body read, “Look what this has to say about
      our managers’ salaries…” Davey often sent her interesting and funny e-mails, and she failed
      to notice that the file attachment icon was unusual before she clicked it.
      Her PC showed the hourglass pointer icon for a second and then the normal pointer reappeared. Nothing happened. She clicked the next e-mail message in the queue. Nothing happened. Her phone rang again. She clicked the ISIS icon on her computer desktop to activate
      the call management software and activated her headset. “Hello, Tech Support, how can I
      help you?” She couldn’t greet the caller by name because ISIS had not responded.
      “Hello, this is Erin Williams in receiving.”
      Amy glanced down at her screen. Still no ISIS. She glanced up to the tally board and was
      surprised to see the inbound-call-counter tallying up waiting calls like digits on a stopwatch.
      Amy had never seen so many calls come in at one time.
      “Hi, Erin,” Amy said. “What’s up?”
      “Nothing,” Erin answered. “That’s the problem.” The rest of the call was a replay of
      Bob’s, except that Amy had to jot notes down on a legal pad. She couldn’t dispatch the
      deskside support team either. She looked at the tally board. It had gone dark. No numbers
      at all.
      Then she saw Charlie running down the hall from the server room. He didn’t look worried
      anymore. He looked frantic.
      Amy picked up the phone again. She wanted to check with her supervisor about what to do
      now. There was no dial tone.






      The next day at SLS found everyone in technical support busy restoring computer systems to
      their former state and installing new virus and worm control software. Amy found herself
      learning how to install desktop computer operating systems and applications as SLS made a
      heroic effort to recover from the attack of the previous day.
